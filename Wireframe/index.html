      <h1>Getting Started with GitHub</h1>
      <p>
        In this blog, we’ll introduce some basic information about GitHub and answer three of the most popular questions: What is the purpose of a README file? What is the purpose of a wireframe? And what is a branch in Git?

        <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
        <p>
          A README file is the main guide for a project. It explains the project’s purpose, structure, 
          and how to use it, often including instructions and a table of contents. 
          It helps others quickly understand the project and the author’s intentions, 
          making collaboration and usage easier. 
          A clear README is essential for any well-organized project.

        <h2>What is the purpose of a wireframe?</h2>
        <p>
          A wireframe is a basic, two-dimensional layout of a webpage, app, or interface. 
          It focuses on structure, placement of elements, and user flow without detailed design. 
          Wireframes help teams visualize ideas, plan content, and make decisions early, saving time 
          and effort by clarifying layout and functionality before full design or development begins.

        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>
          A branch is an independent line of development in a version control system like Git. 
          It allows developers to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments 
          without affecting the main code. Branches are essential for collaboration, testing changes safely, 
          and merging only after review, ensuring the main project remains stable.
